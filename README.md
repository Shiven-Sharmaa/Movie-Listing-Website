##ISSUES:
>>FOR THE BOOKMARK FEATURE, I COULD NOT FIND ANY POST METHOD ON THE API.
  I TRIED TO STORE THE BOOKMARK DATA ON A LOCAL STORAGE IN THE BROWSER.
  HOWEVER WHENEVER REFRESHED THE BOOKMARK DATA KEPT GETTING UPDATED WITH ITS INITIAL STATE DESPITE RETRIEVING THE CORRECT VALUE FROM THE STORAGE

>>FOR THE RATING FEATURE, THE API KEPT SHOWING INVALID API KEY EVEN THOUGH I USED THE KEY FOR RETRIEVING THE MOVIE DETAILS ON THE SAME JS FILE.
  ON GOING TO THE MOVIEDB WEBSITE IT SHOWED INVALID CREDENTIALS ON "TRY IT" EXAMPLE FOR "ADD RATING" POST METHOD.
